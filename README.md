# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver using Dynamic Programming in Rust

This project implements the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using dynamic programming in Rust. The TSP is a classic algorithmic problem in the fields of computer science and operations research, focused on optimization. The problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits a list of cities and returns to the origin city.

## Overview

The TSP solver uses a dynamic programming approach to efficiently find the optimal route. Dynamic programming is chosen due to its ability to break down the problem into simpler subproblems and solve each of these just once, storing their solutions. This significantly reduces the computational complexity compared to a brute-force approach.

## Requirements

To run this code, you need to have Rust installed on your system. Follow the steps below to install Rust and run the TSP solver:

### Installing Rust

1. **Install Rust**:
   - Go to the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the instructions to install Rust.

   Alternatively, you can install Rust using the following command:
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
2. **Verify the installation**:
    After installation, verify that Rust is installed correctly by running:
    ```sh
    rustc --version
    ```

## Running The Program
To get started with the Word Ladder solver, you can clone the repository and run the application either via Command Line Interface (CLI) or Graphical User Interface (GUI).

1. Clone the repository
If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the TSP solver code.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Filbert88/TSP_with_DP.git
``` 
2. Navigate to the project directory:
Change your current directory to the project directory.
```
cd TSP_with_DP
```

3. Navigate to the source directory:
```
cd src
```
4. Run the program:
Use Cargo to build and run the project.
```
cargo run
```

## How to use
At the src folder, There are several txt files. Youu can just simply create one txt file or edit the current txt file which is input.txt. Inside the txt file, you can input a matrix and then run the program and input the txt file name.
